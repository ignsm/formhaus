Add cancellable async navigation and submission hooks, `prevStepAsync()` and `submitAsync()`.
Add radio `autoAdvance` on explicit activation and `next: false` to hide a step's Next button.
Keep keyboard arrow selection within the radio group and focus the destination after navigation.
Report failed after-hooks as committed actions with `FormLifecycleError`.
