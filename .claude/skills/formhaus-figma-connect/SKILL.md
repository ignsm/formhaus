# Bind a design system to the Formhaus plugin

The plugin renders every form element through a **role**. You find a component for each role in the user's design system, confirm it with them, and write the result into the Figma file where they build forms. Afterwards the plugin's **Components** tab shows every role as bound.

## Roles

| Role | What it renders | Search terms |
|---|---|---|
| `field.text` | Text, email, phone, number, password inputs | input, text field, textbox |
| `field.select` | Select and autocomplete | select, dropdown, combobox |
| `field.textarea` | Multi-line text | textarea, text area |
| `field.date` | Date and date-time | date picker, date input |
| `field.file` | File upload | file upload, dropzone |
| `field.checkbox` | A single checkbox with its label | checkbox |
| `field.switch` | A switch with its label | switch, toggle |
| `option.radio` | One row of a radio group | radio |
| `option.checkbox` | One row of a checkbox group | checkbox |
| `button.primary` | Submit and Continue | button primary, button filled |
| `button.secondary` | Back | button secondary, button outline |
| `button.text` | Skip and Cancel | text button, link button, tertiary, ghost |

Roles you skip still render. Select, date, file and text area reuse the bound text field or select. Checkbox, switch and checkbox options reuse each other. Without a text button, Skip and Cancel render as text in the primary button's font and colour. Anything left falls back to the built-in kit. Bind at least `field.text` and `button.primary`.

## Workflow

### 1. Check the connection

Call `whoami`. If it fails, tell the user to set up the Figma MCP server (https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/) and stop.

### 2. Get the target file

Ask for the URL of the Figma file where they design forms. The bindings are stored in that file. Extract `fileKey` from `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName`. The file needs the design system library enabled, or must contain the components itself.

### 3. Find candidates

For each role, run `search_design_system` on the target file with the search terms from the table. Keep the 2–3 best matches per role. Prefer component sets whose variants match the role, for example a `Button` set with `Type=Primary` and `Type=Secondary`. Skip icon-only buttons, chips, cards and banners.

When a match is a component set, pick the variant that looks like an empty, enabled field with a label and no error: `State=Default`, `Size=M`, `Header=True`. For buttons, pick the primary and secondary variants of the same set.

### 4. Confirm with screenshots

Show each candidate with `get_screenshot` and ask the user to confirm the match per role, pick another, or skip the role. Never bind a role the user did not confirm.

### 5. Text slots (only when needed)

The plugin finds the label, value and helper text layers by name (`Label`, `Title`, `Placeholder`, `Value`, `Hint`, `Helper text`, `Supporting text` and similar). If a confirmed component uses other names, read its layers with `get_metadata` and add a `text` entry for that role, for example `{ "label": "Header", "value": "Input text", "helper": "Caption" }`. Use `""` for a slot that should stay empty.

### 6. Write the bindings

Write all confirmed roles in one `use_figma` call on the target file. Use component **keys** for library components. Import each key first so a wrong key fails before anything is saved:

```js
const bindings = {
  'field.text': { source: 'library', key: 'KEY', name: 'Text field / State=Default' },
  'button.primary': { source: 'library', key: 'KEY', name: 'Button / Type=Primary' },
};
const failed = [];
for (const [role, binding] of Object.entries(bindings)) {
  try { await figma.importComponentByKeyAsync(binding.key); } catch { failed.push(role); delete bindings[role]; }
}
const raw = figma.root.getSharedPluginData('formhaus', 'config');
const config = raw ? JSON.parse(raw) : { version: 1, source: 'custom', kit: 'material', bindings: {}, kitNodes: {} };
config.bindings = { ...config.bindings, ...bindings };
config.source = 'custom';
figma.root.setSharedPluginData('formhaus', 'config', JSON.stringify(config));
return { bound: Object.keys(bindings), failed };
```

For components that live in the target file itself, bind by node id instead: `{ source: 'local', id: '12:34', key: 'KEY', name: '…' }`.

A binding can also carry `properties`, the variant and boolean values to set on every instance, keyed like `instance.componentProperties`. It can carry `text`, the slot overrides from step 5. Leave both out unless the user asked for a specific configuration.

### 7. Report

Tell the user which roles are bound, which were skipped and which failed to import. Explain that skipped roles reuse a related component or the built-in kit. Ask them to open the plugin's **Components** tab to check the previews.

## Rules

- Confirm every role with a screenshot before writing it.
- Merge into the existing config, never replace other bindings.
- One `use_figma` write for all roles, after the user has confirmed them.
- Do not invent component keys. Use only keys returned by `search_design_system` or read from the file.
