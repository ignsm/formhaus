# @formhaus/core

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- ae557e6: - **Breaking:** The `FormEngine` constructor throws on duplicate step ids in forms without routes.
  - **Breaking:** `notEmpty` treats an empty array as empty, the same as `required`.
  - `validateField()` returns `null` when a validator returns `''`.
  - **Breaking:** In forms without routes, fields of a skipped step have no value for `matchField`, validators and step hooks, as in forms with routes.
  - `validateDefinition()` reports duplicate step ids in forms without routes.
  - `validateDefinition()` warns when a step condition in a routed form references a field of the same or a later step.
  - `validateDefinition()` says that `FormEngine` rejects a definition with both `fields` and `steps`, instead of saying `fields` is ignored.
  - The constructor error for a definition with both `fields` and `steps` now matches that warning text.
  - The `FormEngine` constructor warns about a `validator` name missing from the `validators` option.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 75e49f2: - New JSON Schema for form definitions at `@formhaus/core/schema.json` and `https://formhaus.dev/schema/form-definition.json`.
- 2bd4c47: - New `skip` step option. A skipped step is left out of submit validation and submitted values.
  - New `skipStep()` and `skipStepAsync()` reset the current step to its defaults and move forward without validation.
  - `skipStepAsync(submit)` submits without the step when no step follows it. Without `submit` it returns `false` and changes nothing.
  - New `isStepSkipped()` method.
  - Pressing Next or Submit on a skipped step, or changing one of its fields, includes it again.
  - `StepChangeContext.reason` can be `'skip'`.
  - New `step_skipped` analytics event type.
  - `validateDefinition()` warns about `skip` on a single-step form or a step with `next: false`.

## 0.7.2

No changes. Version aligned with `@formhaus/react` and `@formhaus/vue`.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 4371c19: - `required` on checkbox and switch fields rejects `false`, so a required box must be checked.
  - Changing an earlier answer that shows or hides another step no longer moves the user off the current step.
  - A `matchField` error clears once the referenced field makes the values match.
  - Errors on fields that leave the active route path are cleared.
  - New `shouldApplyExternalErrors()` helper for custom renderers.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- - New `onBeforeStepChange`, `onAfterStepChange`, `onBeforeSubmit` and `onAfterSubmit` options. A before-hook cancels the action by returning `false`.
  - New `prevStepAsync()`, `submitAsync()` and `cancelPendingActions()` methods and the `submitting` state.
  - New `FormLifecycleError` marks an after-hook failure for an action that already completed.
  - New `autoAdvance` field option and `next: false` step option.
  - New step `routes` choose the next step from answers. Exposes the `StepRoute` type.
  - `FormEngine` throws on invalid routes. `validateDefinition()` reports them and warns when a branch falls through into a sibling branch.

## 0.6.0

No changes. Version aligned with `@formhaus/react` and `@formhaus/vue`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- ad80814: - New `subscribeField()`, `getFieldSnapshot()`, `subscribeStructure()`, and `getStructureSnapshot()` methods expose granular form updates.

### Patch Changes

- 76b2a0d: - `stepValidating` reads `false` in the notification that delivers async step-validation errors.
- 76b2a0d: - `setErrors()` surfaces errors from hidden steps at form level.
  - `reset()` clears loading state and discards pending step validation results.
  - Definition warnings include missing and circular step visibility dependencies.
- ad80814: - `visibleFields` no longer runs current-step validators.
- ad80814: - `reset()` clears values for fields that the reset values hide, instead of keeping them until the next change.
  - Construction clears initial values for fields that other initial values hide, matching `reset()`.
- ad80814: - Visibility cascades now clear dependency chains longer than 50 fields.
  - Deep visibility dependency graphs no longer overflow the call stack during definition validation.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-05-10

### Minor

- New `'autocomplete'` member of `DefaultFieldType` for type-to-filter dropdowns. The default React and Vue renderers use `<input>` + `<datalist>` (native browser filtering, SSR-safe). Note: native `<datalist>` filters by `value`, not `label`, and does not enforce that the typed value is one of the options. See the field types guide.
- New `'datetime'` member of `DefaultFieldType`. The default React and Vue renderers use `<input type="datetime-local">`, which emits `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` without timezone. For richer pickers or ISO output, plug in your own component via `components`. See the field types guide.
- New optional baseline stylesheet at `@formhaus/core/style.css`. Import it for sensible default styling on the native field components: padding, focus state, error colour, button styles, step progress bar. Theme via CSS custom properties (`--fh-color-primary`, `--fh-radius`, `--fh-gap`, etc.). The `sideEffects` field is now `["**/*.css"]` so bundlers preserve the import.

### Patch

- Fixtures are no longer published to npm. They were demo data for the docs and playground, never reachable from consumer code (`exports` only declared the root entry, so `import x from '@formhaus/core/fixtures/basic-form.json'` failed under strict ESM anyway). The Quick Start guide now shows a literal definition object.
- Source maps now ship alongside the minified bundle. Stack traces in consumer apps point at the original source line in `src/`, not minified one-letter variables.
